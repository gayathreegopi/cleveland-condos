# Cleveland Condos Analysis
This project involves a detailed exploration of Cleveland, Ohio, condo listings scraped from Zillow. The analysis is aimed at uncovering trends, factors driving prices, and insights into the Cleveland condo market.

## Project Overview
The project automates data scraping, cleaning, and analysis for Cleveland condo listings, focusing on key attributes such as price, address, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and property descriptions. Visualizations and advanced analyses provide insights into the real estate market dynamics.

## Contributions
- **Web Scraping**: Automated collection of property data using Python libraries such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed and standardized data, handling missing values and formatting details like addresses and square footage.
- **Visualizations**: Created maps and charts to visualize price distributions across streets, price trends, and relationships with features like bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.
- **Street-Level Analysis**: Explored price variations by street and created geospatial visualizations to highlight key areas.
- **Trend Analysis**: Investigated condo price trends over time, identifying potential growth patterns.

## Important Findings
1. **Price Variation Across Streets**: Condo prices vary significantly by street, reflecting differences in location desirability and property features.
2. **Impact of Features on Price**: Square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms emerged as key factors influencing price, with clear trends visible in the data.
3. **Geospatial Insights**: Mapping condo prices highlighted clusters of high-value properties, providing visual context for market behavior.
4. **Missing Data Impact**: Addressing missing data through cleaning and standardization improved the analysis's reliability.
